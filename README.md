# indriver
Unified Flutter project (Passenger and Driver) with bidding system and map integration. Focus on the Brazilian market.
Scope of Unification and Modernization: GoRide Brazil
1. Mandatory Visual Reference (Logo & Style):

Visual Identity: The application must strictly follow the model of the new logo provided (GoRide - Green/White/Black).

Banners and Splash Screen: All loading screens and internal artwork must use this logo and the visual identity of the phrase "GO FOR A RIDE".

2. Profile Switching Interface (inDriver Style):

Switch Button: Implement the button to switch between "Passenger" and "Driver" at the bottom of the screen, easily accessible, according to the inDriver usability standard.

Single Session: The user switches profiles without needing to log out or log in again.

3. Full Localization for Brazil (PT-BR):

Language: 100% of the application in Portuguese (Brazil), including menus, notifications, terms, and error messages.

Regionalization: Currency in Real (R$), metric system in KM, and full focus of Map APIs on Brazilian territory for accurate address searches.

4. Technical Update and Bug Fixes (Priority):

Error Resolution: Fix the JVM-target compatibility error and asset paths in pubspec.yaml.

Version Upgrade: Update the Flutter SDK, Kotlin (1.9+), Gradle, and all plugins to the latest stable versions.

Functionality: Ensure that the bidding system, chat, and wallet function perfectly in the unified app.

5. Visual Theme:

Maintain the color scheme based on the logo (Green and Black), removing any visual trace of the original/foreign code so that the app looks like an official Brazilian product.
